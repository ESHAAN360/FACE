With every passing day, we are becoming more and more dependent upon technology to carry out even the most basic of our actions. Facial detection and Facial recognition help us in many ways, be it sorting of photos in our mobile phone gallery by recognizing pictures with their face in them or unlocking a phone by a mere glance to adding biometric information in the form of face images in the country’s unique ID
database (Aadhaar) as an acceptable biometric input for verification.
This project lays out the basic terminology required to understand the implementation of Face Detection and Face Recognition using Intel’s Computer Vision library called
‘OpenCV’.
It also shows the practical implementation of the Face Detection and Face Recognition using OpenCV with Python embedding on both Windows as well as macOS platform. The aim of the project is to implement Facial Recognition on faces that the script can be trained for. The input is taken from a webcam and the recognized faces are
displayed along with their name in real time.
This project can be implemented on a larger scale to develop a biometric attendance system which can save the time-consuming process of manual attendance system.
